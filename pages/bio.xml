    <h2>Biography</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Before starting at UW I was a master's student in the computer
  science department at ETH Zürich until September 2014. I was being
  mentored by
  <a href="http://people.inf.ethz.ch/troscoe/">Timothy Roscoe</a>.
  The research I was involved in was being done in the context of the
  <a href="http://www.barrelfish.org">Barrelfish</a>
  research OS together with other members of the ETH
  <a href="http://www.systems.ethz.ch">Systems Group</a>.</p>

  <p>I completed my bachelors degree in computer science at ETH Zürich in
  2012 after three years. For more details see my
  <a href="documents/cv.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
