  <p>My research centers on the interplay of software and hardware in
  <strong>post-Moore systems</strong> &mdash; specialized systems comprising
  tightly integrated and co-designed hardware and software components.
  I am interested in the nascent challenges in designing, implementing, and
  maintaining post-Moore systems in different application domains;
  starting with data center network communication and machine learning systems.
  My research develops abstractions, tooling, and methodology for building
  efficient post-Moore systems and applications with manageable complexity and
  cost, through modular and re-usable components.</p>

  <p><strong>In my long-term research agenda, I envision a future where
  specialized, tightly integrated, and efficient post-Moore hardware-software
  systems can be rapidly and efficiently prototyped and evaluated.</strong></p>

  <p>My research is practical in nature, taking ideas all the way to full
  prototype implementations, building concrete solutions to problems in several
  domains, and resulting in top-tier operating systems, networking, and
  architecture publications
    (<strong>SIGCOMM'22</strong>,
    <srtong>NSDI'22/17</strong>,
    <strong>OSDI'20 (distinguished artifact award)/18</strong>,
    <strong>EuroSys'19</strong>,
    <strong>ASPLOS'16 (2x)</strong>)
  alongside substantial open source releases.</p>

  <p>As processor performance in the post-Moore era continues to stagnate,
  satisfying the growing demand for more compute going forward requires radical
  changes throughout the systems stack.
  A proven strategy for continuing to achieve the required order-of-magnitude
  improvements is to move from today's general purpose platforms to post-Moore
  systems designed and optimized for specific problem domains.
  Currently, designing, implementing, and maintaining these systems is a
  complex, laborious, and risky process, accessible to few and only practical
  for the most computing intensive applications.
  I believe this is not fundamental, and have started to explore these
  challenges in the context of data centers before generalizing to other areas
  in the future.</p>

  <p>I have structured my main research agenda into three complementary
  directions addressing different  post-Moore systems challenges:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Designing post-Moore systems to explore the design space for two
      application domains.</li>
    <li>Streamlining the evaluation of post-Moore systems.</li>
    <li>Enabling portability and modularity in the post-Moore era.</li>
  </ol>
